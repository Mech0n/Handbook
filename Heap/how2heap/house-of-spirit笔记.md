# house-of-spirit 笔记

### 0x1 前提

需要的前提是：

`fake addr`必须是内存对齐的

### 0x2 分析

```c
➜  glibc_2.25 git:(master) ✗ ./house_of_spirit
This file demonstrates the house of spirit attack.
Calling malloc() once so that it sets up its memory.
We will now overwrite a pointer to point to a fake 'fastbin' region.
This region (memory of length: 80) contains two chunks. The first starts at 0x7fffffffe498 and the second at 0x7fffffffe4d8.
This chunk.size of this region has to be 16 more than the region (to accommodate the chunk data) while still falling into the fastbin category (<= 128 on x64). The PREV_INUSE (lsb) bit is ignored by free for fastbin-sized chunks, however the IS_MMAPPED (second lsb) and NON_MAIN_ARENA (third lsb) bits cause problems.
... note that this has to be the size of the next malloc request rounded to the internal size used by the malloc implementation. E.g. on x64, 0x30-0x38 will all be rounded to 0x40, so they would work for the malloc parameter at the end.
The chunk.size of the *next* fake region has to be sane. That is > 2*SIZE_SZ (> 16 on x64) && < av->system_mem (< 128kb by default for the main arena) to pass the nextsize integrity checks. No need for fastbin size.
Now we will overwrite our pointer with the address of the fake region inside the fake first chunk, 0x7fffffffe498.
... note that the memory address of the *region* associated with this chunk must be 16-byte aligned.
Freeing the overwritten pointer.
Now the next malloc will return the region of our fake chunk at 0x7fffffffe498, which will be 0x7fffffffe4a0!
malloc(0x30): 0x7fffffffe4a0
```

#### 原理分析

首先要检查`ptr `的地址是否对齐，大小是否合适（一般大小我们自己控制）：

`unsigned long long fake_chunks[10] __attribute__ ((aligned (16)));`这里保证了内存对齐。

`fake_chunks[1] = 0x40; // this is the size`这里伪造了`fastbin`的大小。

```c
/* Little security check which won't hurt performance: the
     allocator never wrapps around at the end of the address space.
     Therefore we can exclude some size values which might appear
     here by accident or by "design" from some intruder.  */
  if (__builtin_expect ((uintptr_t) p > (uintptr_t) -size, 0)
      || __builtin_expect (misaligned_chunk (p), 0))
    {
      errstr = "free(): invalid pointer";
    errout:
      if (!have_lock && locked)
        (void) mutex_unlock (&av->mutex);
      malloc_printerr (check_action, errstr, chunk2mem (p));
      return;
    }
  /* We know that each chunk is at least MINSIZE bytes in size or a
     multiple of MALLOC_ALIGNMENT.  */
  if (__glibc_unlikely (size < MINSIZE || !aligned_OK (size)))
    {
      errstr = "free(): invalid size";
      goto errout;
    }
```

然后会检查`nextchunk(ptr)`是否大小合适(必须大于 `2 * SIZE_SZ`)：

`fake_chunks[9] = 0x1234; // nextsize`伪造下一个`chunk`大小。

```c
#ifndef INTERNAL_SIZE_T
#define INTERNAL_SIZE_T size_t
#endif

/* The corresponding word size */
#define SIZE_SZ                (sizeof(INTERNAL_SIZE_T))
if (__builtin_expect (chunk_at_offset (p, size)->size <= 2 * SIZE_SZ, 0)
	|| __builtin_expect (chunksize (chunk_at_offset (p, size))
			     >= av->system_mem, 0))
      {
	/* We might not have a lock at this point and concurrent modifications
	   of system_mem might have let to a false positive.  Redo the test
	   after getting the lock.  */
  	[···]
			}
```

然后就可以：

```c
a = &fake_chunks[2];
free(a);
```

再次`malloc(0x40 - 0x10)`就可以拿到这部分内存。
